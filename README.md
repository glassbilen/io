# IO library
A file & logging library I made for my personal projects.

# Purpose
A simple logger and file utils libray. It is not meant as an replacement for other such libraries but rather something small, easy to use, io library. This was originally made a few years back, but I did a small clean up and uploaded it.

# Examples
There is a few example classes in the me.glassbilen.samples package. This contains simple implementations of the classes.
